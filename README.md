# pl-log-reader
This is the home for PojavLauncher Log Reader, a fast log analyzer for PojavLauncher.

# What can it do?
As of version 3.0.0, this program can analyze the log and spit out some information about the launcher instance.

# What's the plan for this project?

In two next minor releases, there will be some additions include:

- Checks for basic issues such as: corrupted game, unsupported mods,...
- More support for the iOS platform (I currently don't have any available)
- Checks for valid logs, of course!

# Wait, 3.0? Where are the older ones?

Sadly, it got busted by accident. However, there's another major motivation: It was too slow. (Benchmarks coming soon.)

# How to use the log reader

Usage:
```
</path/to/reader.sh> <log file>
```

Please, don't try to use an invalid log file or I'll murder you :)
