# pl-log-reader
This is the home for PojavLauncher Log Reader, a fast log analyzer for PojavLauncher.

# What can it do?
As of version 3.0.0, this program can analyze the log and spit out some information about the launcher instance.

# What's the plan for this project?

In two next minor releases, there will be some additions include:

- Checks for basic issues such as: corrupted game, unsupported mods,...
- More support for the iOS platform (I currently don't have any available)
- Checks for valid logs, of course!

A big code revamp will be arrived in 4.0, addressing the messy code in 3.x and hopefully providing at least 40% speed boost.

# Wait, 4.0? Where are the older ones?

Sadly, it got busted by accident.

# How to use the log reader

First, get the script, either by cloning the repository or download the script directly from this website.

Usage:
```
</path/to/reader.sh> <log file>
```

Please, don't try to use an invalid log file or I'll murder you :)
